 |	Function:	is_prime
 +-- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
 |	Purpose:	Checks if a given number is prime.
 +-- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
 |	@param:		primes,				The list of known primes.
 |				number, 			The number who will be checked to see if a prime.
 |	@return:	is_prime,			1 if number is prime.
 |									0 if number is not prime.
 +-- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
 |	Algorithm:	Checks if the number has any prime decomposites. If it does, it cannot be
 |				prime. Prime decomposites are primes that have a modularity of zero with it,
 |				and are between 2 and the square root of the number. Every prime below the
 |				square root of two in the primes list is checked for modularity with the 
 |				number. If no matches, 1 is returned. Otherwise, 0 is returned.

 |	Algorithm:	A function is called to see if it is prime. If it is, another function is

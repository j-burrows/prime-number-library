 *	Function:	is_prime
 === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === ===
 *	Purpose:	Checks if a given number is prime.
 === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === ===
 *	@param:		primes,				The list of known primes.
 *				number, 			The number who will be checked to see if a prime.
 *	@return:	is_prime,			1 if number is prime.
 *									0 if number is not prime.
 === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === ===
 *	Algorithm:	Checks if the number has any prime decomposites. If it does, it cannot be
 *				prime. Prime decomposites are primes that have a modularity of zero with it,
 *				and are between 2 and the square root of the number. Every prime below the
 *				square root of two in the primes list is checked for modularity with the 
 *				number. If no matches, 1 is returned. Otherwise, 0 is returned.
